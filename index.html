<p>Music and the Middlebrow is an interdisciplinary, transnational research project
  exploring the relationship between musical culture and the middlebrow.</p>

<p>The project aims both to explore how the distinctive characteristics of musical culture
  might deepen our understanding of the middlebrow, as well as to use the middlebrow to intervene in current debates within musicology.</p>

  <p>Over a three-year period we will bring together scholars from a range of disciplinary
    backgrounds in a series of discussion-focused events, with a view to fostering dialogue
    and facilitating the exchange of ideas. The centrepiece will be a three-day
    <a href="{{ '/conference' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">conference</a>
    held at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu">University of Notre Dame</a>â€™s <a href="http://international.nd.edu/global-gateways/london/">London Global Gateway</a> in June 2017.</p>
