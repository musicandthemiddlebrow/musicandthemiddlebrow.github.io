<p>Music and the Middlebrow is an interdisciplinary, transnational research project
  exploring <a href="{{ '/rationale' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">the relationship between musical culture and the middlebrow</a>.</p>

  <p>Over a three-year period we will bring together scholars from a range of disciplinary
    backgrounds in a series of discussion-focused <a href="{{ '/events' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">events</a>, with a view to fostering dialogue
    and facilitating the exchange of ideas. The centerpiece will be a three-day
    <a href="{{ '/events#conference' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">conference</a>
    held at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu">University of Notre Dame</a>’s <a href="http://international.nd.edu/global-gateways/london/">London Global Gateway</a> in June 2017.</p>
