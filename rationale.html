<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In recent years, the academy has witnessed an explosion of interest in the
  concept of the middlebrow - a term used, on the simplest level, to describe
  cultural practices and products that are neither straightforwardly highbrow
  nor lowbrow, but which fall between the two. The most sustained engagement has
  come from literary and film studies, where the middlebrow has been deployed in
  a variety of different ways. Some scholars have understood the term as
  referring to the institutions responsible for broadening access to elite
  culture, as well as to the modes of dissemination and reception they promoted.
  Others have used it to excavate a set of ideas about cultural values, drawing
  energy from the academy’s current commitment to complicating traditional
  modernist narratives. Still others have engaged with the middlebrow as an
  aesthetic category, inviting a reassessment both of canonical works and of
  works that have traditionally been considered outside the canon.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from such scholarship, musicologists have now begun to turn
  their attention towards many of these issues, exploring directly
  (Chowrimootoo, 2011, 2012; Tunbridge, 2013) or implicitly (Wiebe, 2012;
  Wilson, 2012; Guthrie 2014, 2015) practices, ideas and compositions that
  implicate the middlebrow. For the most part, however, musicological research
  has tended towards a sense of isolation, such that the different aspects of
  the middlebrow – whether institutional, ideological or stylistic – have not
  been thought about in relation to one another. In contrast, the starting
  point for our project is the belief that a more productive way of understanding
  the middlebrow attends to all of these aspects and – crucially - the interaction
  between them: that is, how cultural values, practices and aesthetics evolve
  in dialogue with each other.</p>

<p>With this in mind, this project seeks to bring the concept of the middlebrow
  more fully to bear on musicology, and at the same time, to ask how the case
  of music might challenge accepted understandings of middlebrow culture. By
  establishing dialogue between scholars researching different aspects of music
  and middlebrow culture, we will draw together perspectives from a range of
  disciplines, including musicology, film studies, literary studies, and
  cultural studies. The geographical focus will be Britain and America, where
  the concept originated; the time period will span from the late nineteenth century,
  when seeds of subsequent developments were sown, through the interwar period
  when “middlebrow” entered the vernacular, to its legacy in the present day.</p>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<p>The project has three aims. First, we hope to deepen our understanding of
  those musical practices and cultural products that might usefully be
  understood as middlebrow. More specifically, we want to draw attention to
  a particular cultural milieu that crystallized around a range of pedagogic
  initiatives, critical writings, marketing practices, technological
  developments and compositional styles – all of which combined to broaden
  access to high culture on an unprecedented scale. At the heart of these
  initiatives was a paradoxical set of commitments: on the one hand to the
  ideal of art as transcending the social and political spheres; on the other,
  to art’s potential to transform society.</p>

<p>Second, by exploring the middlebrow as a historical category, we also
  seek to bring the concept to bear on broader disciplinary concerns.
  There remains a division in musicology between scholarship that reduces
  the aesthetic to a form of social value, and that which upholds the
  autonomy of the aesthetic even as it claims to address social contexts.
  This division has intensified despite - or perhaps even because of -
  recent turns towards performance studies, sociology
  and anthropology, and new cultural history. Engaging with the middlebrow offers an alternative
  response - one that seeks not to resolve the tension between social and
  aesthetic concerns, but rather that carves out space for both, as it
  focuses attention on how these two aspects of musical culture develop
  in conversation with one another.</p>

<p>Finally, at a time when calls to establish middlebrow studies as a
  sub-discipline in its own right are growing,it seems pertinent to consider how attending to music might enhance
  middlebrow studies more broadly. For the distinctive characteristics
  of musical culture, such as its ability to transcend linguistic
  boundaries, as well as musicology’s particular relationship to ideas
  of autonomy and formalism, raise new questions that might change the stakes
  of middlebrow debate.</p>
